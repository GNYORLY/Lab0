lab0

This program will read the contents of input filename1 and write it into output filename2.

USAGE

	lab0 [sc] -i filename1 -o filename2

-i denotes the input file
-o denotes the output file
-s creates a segmentation fault within the program
-c registers a signal handler to detect a segmentation fault


lab0.c
This contains the source code of the program.

Makefile
This completes all the necessary steps to compile the program into a distributable form as well as other tasks such as checking or removing the program.

Makefile Options
Using make on its own will just compile the lab0 program.
  dist: using make dist will create a tarball containing the lab0 program files
  clean: using make clean will remove all files previously created using this makefile and return it to its untared state
  check: using make check will initiate a test on the lab0 program to verify if it is working correctly
The checks performed are:
	testComplete - checks if the program successfully finishes
	testOpt - checks if the program will detect invalid arguments
	testIO - checks if the program will detect a file that cannot be read or written to
	testSeg - checks if the program will detect a segmentation fault

backtrace.png 
breakpoint.png
These files contain screenshots of a backtrace and breakpoint at a segmentation fault in lab0 found through the gdb debugger.
